### *Selection of Kattis Problems*

Each folder contains my submitted solutions in Java to the various [Kattis Problems](https://open.kattis.com/). 

The aim of this repository is to help other aspiring Kats who struggles with a certain problem and need some hints. 
It is recommended to **try your own solutions first**, and, if nothing works, take a look at my attempts!
